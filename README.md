# Machine Learning Experiments

A collection of machine learning experiments and mini-projects implemented using **Jupyter Notebooks**.  
This repository is my personal sandbox to explore different ML algorithms, datasets, and techniques.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This repository includes notebooks covering:

- Data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Model training, tuning, and evaluation (regression, classification, clustering)  
- Comparison of algorithms on benchmark datasets  

Each notebook is intended to present a standalone experiment or mini-project.
